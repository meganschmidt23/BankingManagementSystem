# Banking Management System Project

This repository will be used to create a Banking Management System in Java.  

My plan for the project will be to mirror what is mentioned at the codewithc.com website [Code with C](https://www.codewithc.com/online-bank-management-system-project-java/). I do want to add the functionality of being able to send money to people within the bank:
"Before the use of this online banking system, the user should complete Registration. A user holding the bank account is supposed to generate a unique user name and secured password for logging in to the software.  

The following facilities provided by the Online Bank Management software enhance running banking system and make it more easy, accessible and effective.  

The bank customers can view their account details such as account id, type of account, available balance in the account, interest rate etc. from anywhere using internet service.  
The software is made to display deposited cash and date of deposition.  
Online Bank Management System is designed to give details information on cash withdrawal. Customers can see the name & location of ATM with the time of cash withdrawal & amount withdrawn.  
Online money transfer is one of the most desired facilities of bank customers. So, this online software provides online money transaction facility with details.  
Moreover, this project is capable of displaying history of transaction with information such as transaction time, amount and type."  

Later, I will be including a rough visualization of what I would like my project to look like for the user.  

I will be working on this project with contributions from Austin Bristol
